One way to add redux to react:

1. Import createStore from redux in Index.js
2. Initialize store varibale with createStore()
3. Create Store folder in src with file reducer.js in it
4. Import reducer file to index.js and pass it to createStore()
5. Connect store to app:
  5.1 npm install --save react-redux
  5.2 import Provider component to index.js
  5.3 Wrap App in Provider with property 'store' with value of our store variable
6. Connect containers with store
  6.1 import {connect} from 'react-redux'
  6. specify what pieces of state and actions will be used in a container
